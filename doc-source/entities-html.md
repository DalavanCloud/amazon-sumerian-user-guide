# Amazon Sumerian HTML Component<a name="entities-html"></a>

The HTML component adds a 2D HTML document \(a `div`\) to the scene, and lets you edit its content in the text editor\. You can position the document using the entity transform, or use CSS to position it relative to the viewport\.

**Properties**
+ **Move with transform** – Position the HTML document within the scene using the transform component on the same entity\. The document is always the same size and faces the camera, but can move relative to the camera\. Deselect to position the HTML content relative to the viewport, with a style attribute\.
+ **Pixel perfect** – When positioning with the entity transform, snap the HTML window to the closest pixel position\.
+ **Attributes** – Add HTML attributes to the `div`\. For example, you can add a style attribute to position the HTML content on screen\.
