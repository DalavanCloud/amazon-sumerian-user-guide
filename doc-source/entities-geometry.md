# The Amazon Sumerian Geometry Component<a name="entities-geometry"></a>

The *Geometry* panel contains a renderable mesh or primitive on the entity\. When you import a 3D model, or create a primitive from the *Create Entity* dialog, it will always get a Geometry component\.

Together with a Material component, the Geometry can be rendered\. If you don't have a Material component, the geometry will be invisible\.

The panel looks different for different kinds of meshes and primitives, but in general, they have these settings:

**Properties**

+ Cast shadows

+ Receive shadows

+ Dimensions and/or number of samples \(primitives only\)
