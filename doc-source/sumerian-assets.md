# Assets<a name="sumerian-assets"></a>

The assets panel collects shareable assets in the scene\. When you add an asset to a scene, Sumerian automatically adds it to a *default pack* in the assets panel\. Entities that you create are not automatically added, but you can drag them from the entities panel into the assets panel to create an entity asset\.

**Asset Types**

To add an asset to a scene, you can drag it from your desktop directly onto the canvas\. Depending on the file type, the editor creates an entity in the entities panel, and one or more assets\. For example, when you add a JPG image to a scene, you get an image entity in the scene, a material asset, and a texture asset\.

1. Drag a file from your desktop file browser onto the canvas\.
