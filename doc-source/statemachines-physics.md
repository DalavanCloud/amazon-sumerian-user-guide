# Amazon Sumerian State Machine Physics and Collision Actions<a name="statemachines-physics"></a>

You can use state machine actions to apply physics and check for collisions\.

**Physics and Collision Actions**
+ **Apply force** – Apply a force to the attached rigid body\.
+ **Apply impulse** – Apply an impulse to the attached rigid body\.
+ **Apply torque** – Apply a torque to the attached rigid body\.
+ **Camera distance** – Perform a transition based on the distance to the main camera or to a location\.
+ **In box** – Perform a transition based on whether an entity is inside a user\-defined box volume or not\. The volume is defined by setting two points which, when connected, form a diagonal through the box volume\.
+ **Set rigid body angular velocity** – Change the angular velocity of a rigid body\.
+ **Set rigid body position** – Change the position of a rigid body\.
+ **Set rigid body rotation** – Change the rotation of a rigid body\.
+ **Set rigid body velocity** – Change the velocity of a rigid body\.
+ **Trigger enter** – Transition when a trigger volume is entered\.
+ **Trigger leave** – Transition when a collider is leaving the trigger volume\.
